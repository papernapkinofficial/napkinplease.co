# Paper Napkin — Media. Management. Marketing.

Paper Napkin helps founder‑led and hospitality brands tell stories that stick.

We combine strategic thinking with hands‑on creative execution to build memorable
brand experiences that connect with people — not just algorithms.

What we do

- Media creation: campaign shoots, podcast production, and visual storytelling
  crafted with purpose.
- Marketing strategy: thoughtful campaign and content strategy that aligns your
  brand with the audience you want to reach.
- Brand management: PR, newsletters, and social handled personally to keep
  your voice clear, consistent, and evolving.

Our approach

We believe great work happens where instinct meets intention. We don’t force
brands into a template — we uncover what makes you different and build around
it. The best ideas are often sketched on a napkin; our job is to turn that
spark into something unforgettable.
